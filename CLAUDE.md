# Media Bulk Downloads — repo guide for Claude Code

Cross-browser (Chrome · Firefox · Edge · Safari) Manifest-V3 extension that
bulk-downloads images/video/audio from any page, built with **WXT** in a
**yarn-workspaces monorepo**. Node **20.19+** (`.nvmrc` pins 22), **Corepack Yarn
`4.17.1` — never npm**.

## Commands (run from the repo root)

```bash
yarn dev            # Chrome dev (HMR) → apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3
yarn build          # also :firefox :edge :safari :all
yarn zip            # store zips → apps/extension/.output/  (also :firefox :edge :all)
yarn type-check     # wxt prepare + tsc -b + tsc --noEmit   (run before trusting tsc)
yarn lint           # eslint (whole workspace)
yarn test           # vitest + coverage (packages) then the app suite (~3000 tests)
yarn test:e2e       # Playwright, real Chromium, drives the on-page bubble
```

The pre-PR gate is `yarn type-check && yarn lint && yarn test && yarn build`.
**Check the real exit code** — piping a gate through `tail`/`grep` masks it
(`echo $?` / `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`). Or use `/gate`.

## Layout & the one rule

Four workspaces; import direction is **one-way: app → storage/platform → core**.

- `packages/core` (`@mbd/core`) — pure domain logic (collection, resolvers,
  sniffers, download byte-logic, net). **No `chrome.*`, imports no other package.**
- `packages/storage` (`@mbd/storage`) — `chrome.storage` + IndexedDB stores.
- `packages/platform` (`@mbd/platform`) — browser-capability contracts + detection.
- `apps/extension` (`@mbd/extension`) — the WXT app; the only layer that touches
  `chrome.*` freely.

Each package/app has a README; deep design in `docs/guides/` +
`docs/architecture/monorepo-restructure.md`.

## Conventions

- **Yarn only, never npm.** Never stage `package.json` / `yarn.lock` / `.yarnrc.yml`
  unless the change is intentionally about deps.
- **Minimal comments — keep code self-documenting.** Don't add verbose multi-line
  `//` WHY blocks; keep only JSDoc + functional directives (`eslint-disable`,
  `@ts-*`, `@vitest-environment`, `///`). For a bulk strip use a TypeScript-parser
  pass, never regex.
- **Ship flow:** branch off `main` (`feat/…` `fix/…` `docs/…` `chore/…`) → commit →
  push → PR → **`gh pr merge <n> --merge --delete-branch`**. **Merge commits only —
  never squash or rebase.** Sync `main` after. (`/ship` automates this.)
- **No `Claude-Session` trailers or links** in commits, PRs, or issues.
- On a shipped **product** change, add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` entry
  (docs/tooling changes don't get one).
- Confirm before outward/irreversible actions (pushes, merges, store uploads).

## Skills (reach for these first)

`.claude/skills/`: **adding-a-resolver** (new site support — recon-probe first,
close if generic already wins), **extension-dev** (where code goes, MV3 pitfalls),
**storage-and-settings** (persistence, the settings-write path), **releasing**
(version bump → stores → tag), **testing-and-verifying** (Vitest + browser
verify), **ui-design-system** (the `mbd:`-prefixed Tailwind + token/component
classes). Each skill has self-contained `references/` files carrying the required
data (external URLs are optional further reading only).

## Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

- **`/ship`** — branch → commit → PR → merge (merge commit, delete branch) → sync.
- **`/gate`** — the pre-PR gate with real exit codes.
- **Site support** — `/find-resolver` (search new sites worth supporting →
  candidates), `/recon <site>` (probe one candidate → build-or-close),
  `/add-resolver <site>` (build a new one end to end, TDD), `/improve-resolver
  <name>` (audit + fix an existing site/sniffer against the live site).
