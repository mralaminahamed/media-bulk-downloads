description: Ship this extension — cut a release and publish to the Chrome Web Store, Microsoft Edge Add-ons, and Firefox Add-ons (AMO) — and reason about its permissions and privacy posture. Use when bumping the version, packaging store zips, updating listing/store metadata, tagging a release, working on the tag-triggered release.yml workflow, debugging a Chrome Web Store API publish failure (unauthorized_client, invalid_grant, publisherId, Unauthorized), editing manifest permissions, adding an API that needs a new permission, writing store justifications, or answering "what data does it collect / is this private". Covers the OAuth/credential setup the CWS publish needs.

# Releasing & publishing

One version bump propagates everywhere: WXT writes `package.json`'s `version`
into every browser's manifest.

## Steps

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` (move `[Unreleased]` items under the new version).
2. Bump `version` in `package.json` (semver).
3. Package all stores:
   ```bash
   corepack yarn zip:all
   ```
   Produces in `apps/extension/.output/`:
   - `media-bulk-downloads-<version>-chrome.zip`
   - `media-bulk-downloads-<version>-edge.zip`
   - `media-bulk-downloads-<version>-firefox.zip` **+** `-sources.zip`
4. Validate the Firefox build: `corepack yarn lint:firefox` (web-ext, expect 0 errors).
5. Upload:
   - **Chrome Web Store** → [Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole), the `-chrome.zip`.
   - **Edge Add-ons** → [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge), the `-edge.zip` (same Chromium package family; the CWS copy/justifications apply).
   - **Firefox (AMO)** → [addons.mozilla.org/developers](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/), the `-firefox.zip` plus the `-sources.zip` when prompted (AMO requires source for bundled add-ons).
6. Tag the release: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
   The tag **must** equal `package.json`'s `version` (release.yml enforces this).

Convention here: bump version + CHANGELOG on a branch → PR → merge to main →
tag the merge commit. Manual store uploads (step 5) are still done by hand except
Chrome, which the tag can auto-publish (below).

Store status: Chrome / Firefox (AMO) / Edge are **live**; Opera and Safari are
**submitted, under review**.

## Safari (Mac App Store) — separate flow

Safari is **not** in `zip:all`/`build:all`. It ships as a native macOS app wrapping
the extension, built on macOS only:

```bash
corepack yarn build:safari        # → apps/extension/.output/safari-mv3
./apps/safari-native/convert.sh   # safari-web-extension-converter → Xcode project
```

Then sign + submit through Xcode / App Store Connect (needs an Apple Developer
account). The Safari manifest drops `downloads`/`offscreen` + optional
`notifications`/DNR; the `@mbd/platform` seam supplies the fallbacks, and MAIN-world
sniffers are inert (DOM-only collection). Full runbook + caveats:
`docs/store-submissions/SAFARI_APPSTORE.md`, `apps/safari-native/README.md`.

## Automated release (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag runs three jobs:

- **validate** — lint / type-check / test.
- **release** — `yarn zip:all`, then a **GitHub Release** with all four zips
  attached and the matching `## [X.Y.Z]` CHANGELOG section as the body.
- **publish-chrome** — pushes the Chrome zip to the Web Store via Google's
  **official REST API with plain `curl`** (no npm package — the
  `chrome-webstore-upload-cli` path broke, see below). `workflow_dispatch`
  re-runs publish-chrome against the current `package.json` version without a new
  tag: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref <branch>`.

The GitHub Release always works; the Chrome publish depends on credentials being
right (below). Edge/Firefox/Opera stay manual — grab their zips from the Release.

## Chrome Web Store API publishing

`publish-chrome` calls the CWS API directly with `curl` — the **v1.1 item-scoped**
endpoint (needs only `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`, no publisher id): OAuth token → `PUT`
upload → `POST` publish. Four secrets, all a **matched set from one "Web
application" OAuth client**: `CHROME_CLIENT_ID`, `CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`.

Full setup — minting the refresh token step by step, the v1.1-vs-v2 rationale, and
the `invalid_grant` / `unauthorized_client` / `Unauthorized` / `publisherId` error
catalog — is in **`references/chrome-webstore-api.md`**. Re-publish the current
version without a new tag: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref <branch>`.

## Permissions & privacy (keep in sync with the store justifications)

Declared in `apps/extension/wxt.config.ts` (manifest function). Keep this list and
`docs/store-submissions/CHROME_WEBSTORE.md` §4 in sync.

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `downloads` | Save selected media via `chrome.downloads.download` |
| `downloads.open` | Open a downloaded file from in-app history (`chrome.downloads.open`) |
| `storage` | Settings (`storage.sync`) + history (`storage.local`), on-device |
| `tabs` | Read active tab URL/title to label downloads and open a source URL |
| `contextMenus` | Right-click actions (download all / this image, favourites) |
| `offscreen` | Assemble HLS/DASH streams in an offscreen document |
| host `<all_urls>` | Read media on any page; opt-in original-resolution fetches to media CDNs |

Optional (requested at runtime when the feature enables, never at install):

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `notifications` | Desktop toast when a batch finishes (Settings → Downloads) |
| `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` | "Retry w/ referer" on a hotlink-403: a short-lived single-URL session rule sets the source page as `Referer`/`Origin`, torn down immediately. Must be this variant — Chrome drops plain `declarativeNetRequest` from `optional_permissions`. |

**Before adding a permission:** can an existing one do it? (`activeTab` vs
`<all_urls>` — but this extension genuinely needs all-URLs for the badge +
on-any-page collection.) Adding one (esp. `downloads.open`) triggers a
re-permission prompt on update and needs a store justification — add both. Firefox
MV3 also needs `browser_specific_settings.gecko.data_collection_permissions` (this
extension declares `['none']`).

**Privacy stance (must stay true):**

- **Network-free by default** — collection only reads what the page already loaded.
  The one opt-in exception (`resolveOriginals`) fetches higher-res originals
  **directly from the media's own CDN**, host-pinned, only while downloading.
- **No servers, no analytics, no accounts.** Settings/history never leave the
  device (sync settings stay in the user's own Chrome sync). The durable IndexedDB
  mirror of history/favourites/excluded/queue (via `navigator.storage.persist()`)
  is on-device and needs **no** manifest permission.
- **Scheme allowlist:** only `http(s)` (and `data:image`) is surfaced;
  page-supplied ids are shape-validated before URL interpolation, API-JSON URLs
  pinned to https + expected host. `PRIVACY.md` is the published policy — update it
  if data handling ever changes.

## Store listing assets & copy

The full submission package — paste-ready name/summary/description, category,
per-permission justifications, privacy/data disclosures, screenshot specs — lives
in `docs/store-submissions/CHROME_WEBSTORE.md` (and the per-store siblings
`EDGE_ADDONS.md`, `FIREFOX_AMO.md`, `OPERA_ADDONS.md`, `SAFARI_APPSTORE.md`).
Privacy policy: `PRIVACY.md` (hosted at the repo's public URL). Screenshots: seven
1280×800 24-bit PNGs (no alpha) — `assets/v2/screenshot-1-…-1280x800.png` through
`-7-…`; Opera also wants `assets/v2/opera-promo-300x188.png`. Other Chromium
browsers (Brave/Opera/Vivaldi) use the Chrome zip.
