## The one-line take

**No single competitor is strong on more than one of: media breadth, extraction
depth, in-page ease, and trust.** Image grabbers stop at images; video rippers
ignore images; the CLIs win on extraction but have no GUI and must be installed and
constantly updated. Media Bulk Downloads aims for the quadrant no other single tool
occupies: CLI-grade, site-aware extraction with extension-grade, one-click ease —
across images **and** video **and** audio.

## Capture & output capability

¹ `srcset` / CDN thumbnail→original / de-proxy / site-aware resolvers.
² Imageye: WebP→JPG only.
³ Link/URL extractor, not a page-scanning image scraper.
⁴ Video-format transcode (ffmpeg), not raster image conversion.
⁵ FetchV: HLS→MP4 solid; DASH not clearly supported.
⁶ Site-specific extractors driven by a URL you supply, not a scan of the page you're viewing.

## Product, distribution & trust

⁷ Was MIT under the original author; now owned by an acquirer — current licensing/trust unclear.
⁸ Declares local, but reverse-image-search + social features imply outbound calls; opaque vendor.
⁹ Clipboard/link handoff into a separate desktop app — not in-page.

## Honest ceilings

We are genuinely behind on two fronts, and won't pretend otherwise:

- **DRM and YouTube video are ❌ for every consumer tool here** — a Web Store
  policy + MV3 ceiling, not a bug we can fix.
- **The CLIs (yt-dlp ~1,800, gallery-dl 300+) beat everyone on breadth of
  site-aware extractors and metadata** — versus our ~60 resolvers. That's a scope
  gap we close over time; see the [coverage matrix](../benchmark/coverage-matrix.md)
  and [gaps](../benchmark/gaps.md).

Where we lead is the combination: the only row that is ✅ across image **and** video
capture **and** in-page UX **and** local / open-source / free.
